# Quiz 3 *** Due Thursday Week 4


# Reading the number written in base 8 from right to left,
# keeping the leading 0's, if any:
# 0: move N     1: move NE    2: move E     3: move SE
# 4: move S     5: move SW    6: move W     7: move NW
#
# We start from a position that is the unique position
# where the switch is on.
#
# Moving to a position switches on to off, off to on there.
